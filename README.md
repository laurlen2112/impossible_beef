# Module 12: Impossible Beef

## Overview:

The purpose of this challenge is to create an interactive dashboard deployed on [GitHub Pages](https://laurlen2112.github.io/impossible_beef/index.html) that allows researchers to view sample data for individual test subjects. The website is designed to filter information based on the selected test subject, as illustrated below.

The research subject in focus is the bacterial strains found in the human navel. The dashboard includes demographic data, a bar chart that displays the top 10 bacterial strains for each subject, a bubble chart that visualizes the bacteria cultures by sample and quantity, and a gauge that shows the number of times the subject washed their navel per week. This comprehensive dashboard allows researchers to analyze and compare the bacteria strains across multiple subjects to identify patterns and trends.

In addition to the technical skills gained from this challenge, I enjoyed the process of creating an interactive website and working with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Developing a user-friendly and visually appealing dashboard was a fun and rewarding experience. It allowed me to apply my knowledge of web development to a real-world project and gave me the opportunity to enhance my problem-solving and design skills.
